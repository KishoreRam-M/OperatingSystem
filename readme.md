## 🔄 Full OS Concepts Roadmap

### 1. 🧩 Introduction to Operating Systems
Functions, types (batch, real-time, distributed, embedded), kernel vs shell, system calls.

### 2. ⚙️ Process Management
Process states, lifecycle, scheduling, threads vs processes, IPC mechanisms.

### 3. 🧮 CPU Scheduling
Algorithms: FCFS, SJF, RR, priority, multilevel queues, Gantt charts.

### 4. 🔒 Process Synchronization
Critical sections, race conditions, semaphores, monitors, classic problems.

### 5. ⚠️ Deadlocks
Conditions, resource graphs, handling: prevention, avoidance, detection, recovery.

### 6. 🧠 Memory Management
Address translation, allocation strategies, fragmentation, paging, segmentation.

### 7. 💡 Virtual Memory
Page faults, replacement algorithms (FIFO, LRU, Optimal), thrashing, COW.

### 8. 📁 File Systems
File types, allocation methods, directories, inodes, access control.

### 9. 💽 Disk Management
Disk formatting, scheduling (SCAN, C-SCAN), RAID levels 0–6.

### 10. 🔌 I/O Management
DMA, interrupts, buffering, caching, device drivers.

### 11. 🔐 Security & Protection
ACLs, domains, malware, buffer overflows, encryption, firewalls.

### 12. 🚀 Advanced OS Topics
Virtualization, hypervisors, Docker, RTOS, Linux kernel, micro vs monolithic.
